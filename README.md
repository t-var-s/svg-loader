### svg-loader custom web component

An element that loads SVG code into the DOM so that it can be fully styled. Get your vector icons in at any color. 

Use a `src` attribute to load that SVG file asynchronously. From the demo:
```html
<svg-loader src="img/settings.svg"></svg-loader>
```

*The demo uses four [Tabler Icons](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons) that are MIT licensed.*
*svg-loader is made available through an AGPL v3 license.*
