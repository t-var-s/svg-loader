### svg-loader custom web component

An element that loads SVG code into the DOM so that it can be fully styled. 

Get your vector icons in at any color. 

![svg-loader](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05eb384f-780a-4377-ba35-41905e7fd1a6)

Use a `src` attribute to load that SVG file asynchronously. From the demo:
```html
<svg-loader src="img/settings.svg"></svg-loader>
```
You can just include something like:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/t-var-s/svg-loader/svg-loader.js"></script>
```
in the `<head>` of your page to use the `<svg-loader>` tag.


*The demo uses four [Tabler Icons](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons) that are MIT licensed.*

*svg-loader is made available through an AGPL v3 license.*
